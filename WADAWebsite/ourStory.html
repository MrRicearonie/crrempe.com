                    <h3></br></br></br>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>WADA was created by River Yearian (yeariar@wwu.edu), Cameron Wallace (wallac21@wwu.edu), Christopher Rempe (rempec@wwu.edu), and Jayson Morberg (morberj2@wwu.edu) for Western Washington University's Winter 2021 CSCI
                        412 class by Dr. Shameem Ahmed.</p>
                    <p>We decided to set out and create an app that would remind you that your plants needed to be watered since we know
                        people with many plants which have become a chore to maintain a consistent watering schedule for.</p>
                    <p>We used multiple screens for each part of the app: showing your plants, what you need to water for the day,
                        creation/edit of a plant, and a map. We used Firebase to store all of the data in the cloud. A sound will play when
                        you start up the app, and you can take a picture of the plant with the camera on your device. Google maps was
                        included using a fragment.</p>
                    <p>We looked at similar apps, including: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kosev.watering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterbot</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>After we took a look at these apps, the things that helped make decisions on how WADA would be set up includes a simple three page design, pictures for the plant profiles, and the ability to take notes. We did notice a lack of being able to add a plant to a specific room on some of these apps. A feature that was very important to us.</p>

                    <h2></br>App Evolution</h2>
                    <p>WADA has definitely evolved though the checkpoints due to time constraints. We originally were going to have a plant
                    that grew every time you successfully watered your plants for the day as well as having a plant dictionary, but sadly we
                    had to scrap both. We also were going to have a GPS feature that we just could not get implemented in time, and are left
                    with just a map.</p>
                    <p>Besides those things, our app progressed decently well. We first set up the account infrastructure with sign ups and
                    logins, then added the ability to add a plant to said profile. Being able to update the plants, and set the watering
                    schedule was up next, as well as getting the plants to show up for each day's watering page. We then added the
                    notifications and the map. We spent sometime polishing things at the end. Things took longer than expected since we
                    decided early on to use the Flutter framework to build the app instead of Java, and ran into some interesting issues
                    with that, including null pointer errors, and some confusion on how to implement some things that we needed.</p>
                    
                    <h2></br>Final Product</h2>
                    <h4>MVC</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Model - Our model communicated with the database to get the login information, as well as getting the data for the plants.
                        </br>       The model also will take in the information from the plant creation page and send it to the Firebase to be added.
                        </li>
                        <li>View - Our view will display the login page, as well as each page in the app.
                        </br>       The view will display the data from the Firebase that was given to it from the model.
                        </li>
                        <li>Controller - Our controller take in the user input to create a plant, and sends it off to the model to be added to the Firebase.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p>WADA currently allows the user to login/signup, add multiple plants to their profile, view all of their plants and 
                        view just the plants that need to be watered that day. Each "plant profile" includes the name, picture, days of the 
                        the week they need to be watered, their location in the house, and a space for any notes you want to take. When the 
                        user goes to the watering page they are shown the plants that need to be watered separated by the rooms that they 
                        are in. By clicking on the check box by their name, it will set them as watered and remove them from the list. A 
                        notification will be sent out if a plant needs to be watered for the day.</p>
                    <p>Photos for these features are on the previous page</p>

                    <h2></br>Future Work</h2>
                    <p>Since we used Flutter, the app definitely needs to be debugged more as well as optimizing the codebase so it will 
                        run faster. After that, we can start adding the features we just didn't have time to implement. This includes adding 
                        the growing plant every time the user waters all of their plants for the day, the plant dictionary, and being able to 
                        use the GPS to remind the user that they should get someone else to water their plants for them if they are out of 
                        a certian radius around their plants. This could also give users the ability to water other user's plants, making sure 
                        the virtual plant in the app keeps growing, and the user's plants stay happy.</p>
